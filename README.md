# Xfwm4-Theme

If you're lazy or don't know what you're doing (like myself):

* Find Adapta theme folder (/usr/share/themes/Adapta)
* Copy paste Adapta or Adapta-Nokto to Whatever you want to call it
* Replace the xfwm folder and index.theme file in the new folder
* You may tweak the files with the .xcf file in the root directory
* You may rename the theme in xfwm/index.theme
* Go to Xfce's Settings Manager
* Select Window Manager
* Select your theme
